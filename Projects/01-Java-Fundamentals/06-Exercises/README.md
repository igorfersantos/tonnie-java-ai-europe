# A note about these exercises

I also challenged myself to remember how to manually compile a java project into a runnable standalone jar using only: a terminal, jar and vim. 

each exercise contains a compile.sh script and a manifest.txt to compile a self-contained runnable jar containing the exercise

References I used to do it:
