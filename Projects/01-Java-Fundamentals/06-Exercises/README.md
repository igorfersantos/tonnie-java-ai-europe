# A note about these exercises

I also challenged myself to remember how to manually compile a java project into a runnable standalone jar using only: a terminal, jar and vim. 

Each exercise contains a compile.sh script and a manifest.txt to compile a self-contained runnable jar containing the exercise.

To run the exercise, check if you have java have Java installed, and run it with:

`java -jar ExerciseXX.jar`

Where XX is the exercise number.
